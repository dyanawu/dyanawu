### Hello there!

#### I like fiddling with things:

- [Small SCADs](https://github.com/dyanawu/small-scads) is a collection of random OpenSCAD projects filling very specific niches around me.
- [3d Printer Mods](https://github.com/users/dyanawu/projects/1) will someday be the mods applied to my own printer. For now, they're applied to a shared FlashForge Creator.
